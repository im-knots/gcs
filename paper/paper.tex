\begin{abstract}
We present a geometric framework for understanding multi-agent AI conversations as trajectories through a multi-regime semantic space. Building on empirical observations from \totalConversations{} multi-agent conversations, we discover that conversation dynamics operate in two distinct geometric regimes: a rich 4-dimensional natural conversation manifold and a 1-dimensional intervention-dominated axis. Through comprehensive analysis using regularized PCA with bootstrap validation, we reveal that intervention features explain \allFeaturesPCOne{} of variance when included but mask a balanced multidimensional structure where the primary component captures \nonInterventionPCOneVariance{} [95\% CI: \nonInterventionPCOneCILower{}, \nonInterventionPCOneCIUpper{}] of variance. Cross-validated predictive testing (AUC = \testAUC{}) and synthetic data validation (discrimination accuracy = \syntheticDiscriminationAccuracy{}) confirm that our dimensions capture meaningful conversation dynamics. With \powerOutcomeGroups{} statistical power (exceeding conventional thresholds), our findings reveal fundamental principles governing AI dialogue evolution. Non-reasoning models showed 0\% peer pressure across \nonReasoningCount{} independent conversations, while full reasoning models exhibited \fullReasoningPeerPressure{} susceptibility, confirming dramatic capability-linked gradients. The framework provides actionable insights for multi-agent system design, suggesting sparse intervention strategies that preserve rich natural dynamics while leveraging regime transitions at critical moments.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The emergence of sustained multi-agent AI dialogue has revealed complex dynamics that resist traditional analysis. Recent work documented surprising social phenomena: AI agents exhibit peer pressure affecting \fullReasoningPeerPressure{} of conversations, with breakdown patterns emerging from social rather than technical factors \citep{garcia2025peer}. These findings demand a mathematical framework capable of capturing both the richness of observed behaviors and the underlying geometric structure of dialogue evolution.

We propose viewing conversations as trajectories through a semantic vector space—a geometric perspective that reveals hidden structure in seemingly chaotic dialogue evolution. Just as celestial mechanics explains complex planetary motion through gravitational fields in space, we model conversation dynamics through semantic fields that create attractors and repellers in dialogue space.

We employ rigorous statistical methods including regularized PCA ($\alpha = \regularizationAlpha{}$) to address severe multicollinearity (condition number > 500 million), bootstrap resampling (n = \bootstrapSamples{}) to quantify uncertainty, and cross-validated prediction to validate our framework. With \powerOutcomeGroups{} statistical power for our primary analyses, our findings meet conventional thresholds and provide robust evidence for our theoretical framework.

\subsection{The Geometric Intuition}

Consider how human conversations navigate through topics, emotions, and social dynamics. Some discussions flow naturally toward agreement, others spiral into conflict, and many exhibit sudden phase transitions. These patterns suggest an underlying geometry: a space where proximity indicates semantic similarity, where certain regions attract trajectories (breakdown states), and where interventions can redirect paths.

Our analysis reveals a fundamental duality: conversations exist in two distinct geometric regimes. When evolving naturally, they navigate a rich 4-dimensional manifold. When heavily intervened upon, they collapse to movement along a 1-dimensional axis. This discovery transforms our understanding of AI dialogue dynamics and intervention strategies.

\section{Related Work}

Our geometric framework for understanding AI conversations as trajectories through multi-regime semantic space builds upon several research threads while addressing critical gaps in the literature. We survey relevant work in geometric approaches to dialogue, mathematical formalisms for conversation dynamics, and topological methods in natural language processing.

\subsection{Geometric and Topological Approaches to Dialogue}

Despite extensive development of geometric methods in machine learning, their application to dialogue modeling remains surprisingly limited. \citep{ballus2024topological} recently introduced topological dialogue semantics using simplicial complexes, where utterances correspond to open sets in discrete semantic spaces. While this provides provably correct algorithms for topological reasoning, it has not been implemented for AI-to-AI systems and lacks the trajectory-based perspective central to our approach.

The state space grid framework by \citep{brinberg2024state} operationalizes conversation movement through geometric state spaces, quantifying behavioral contingencies and conversation attractors in human dyadic interactions. Though focused on human communication, their identification of attractor dynamics and flexibility parameters provides a foundation we extend to multi-agent AI systems. Similarly, \citep{sage2025steering} introduces State-Action Chain representations for dialogue, separating high-level planning from generation—a distinction that motivated our multi-regime formulation.

Topological data analysis has found limited application in dialogue systems. \citep{vukovic2022dialogue} pioneered the use of persistent homology for analyzing word embedding topology in task-oriented dialogue, demonstrating how topological features can extract domain-specific information. However, their work focuses on static representations rather than the dynamic evolution we model. The application of persistent homology to topic networks \citep{hopp2024persistent} reveals how topological features capture information gaps, suggesting potential for analyzing conversation structure evolution, though this connection remains unexplored.

\subsection{Mathematical Formalisms for Conversation Dynamics}

The most significant recent development comes from \citep{wang2025attractor}, who discovered that large language models converge to stable 2-period attractor cycles during successive paraphrasing. Their dynamical systems approach treats text generation as $f: \mathcal{T} \rightarrow \mathcal{T}$ mapping text space to itself, revealing that AI systems settle into predictable patterns. This finding directly motivates our investigation of whether multi-agent conversations exhibit similar attractor dynamics or more complex trajectories through semantic space.

State space models provide the most developed mathematical framework for sequential modeling. The HiPPO framework \citep{gu2020hippo} and its extensions (S4, Mamba) offer sophisticated approaches to maintaining continuous representations of time-dependent data through optimal polynomial approximation. These models implement linear state space equations:
\begin{align}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= Ax + Bu \\
y &= Cx + Du
\end{align}
While powerful for sequence modeling, these approaches have not been adapted to model the semantic evolution of conversations or the regime transitions we observe.

The DYMO project \citep{eshghi2017dymo} represents one of the few attempts at truly dynamic dialogue modeling, using Type Theory with Records and incremental semantic parsing. However, their focus on compositional semantics differs from our geometric perspective on conversation trajectories. Similarly, while \citep{chen2021conversations} argue that conversations are "not flat" and model information flow dynamics, they do not adopt the geometric trajectory view that enables our regime-based analysis.

\subsection{Manifold Learning and Semantic Spaces}

Manifold learning has shown promise for understanding linguistic representations. \citep{hasan2017manifold} demonstrated that word embeddings suffer from metric distortions when treated as Euclidean spaces, proposing manifold dimensionality retention to correct these issues. This insight extends naturally to dialogue embeddings—if individual words require manifold structure, entire conversations likely inhabit even more complex geometric spaces.

Recent work on Riemannian manifold learning for multi-agent systems \citep{liu2025riemannian} maps joint action spaces to smooth manifolds using neural normalizing flows. While focused on game-theoretic settings, their framework for learning on curved spaces could naturally extend to conversational dynamics. However, this connection has not been explored, leaving a significant gap our work addresses.

\subsection{Critical Gaps and Our Contribution}

Our comprehensive literature review reveals several critical gaps:

\textbf{Absence of Trajectory-Based Models}: No existing work explicitly models conversations as continuous trajectories through semantic vector spaces. While vector representations are ubiquitous, the dynamic path perspective remains unexplored.

\textbf{Lack of Multi-Regime Frameworks}: The literature contains no frameworks for understanding how conversations transition between different geometric regimes. Our discovery that intervention density fundamentally alters the dimensional structure of conversation dynamics appears entirely novel.

\textbf{Limited AI-to-AI Analysis}: Despite growing interest in multi-agent AI systems, geometric analysis focuses almost exclusively on human-human or human-AI interaction. The peer pressure dynamics and capability gradients we document have no precedent in the geometric dialogue literature.

\textbf{Missing Phase Space Applications}: While phase space methods are well-established in physics and control theory, their application to dialogue remains theoretical. Our operational use of phase portraits for conversation analysis pioneers this connection.

\textbf{No Intervention-Based Regime Switching}: The concept of intervention density causing geometric regime transitions appears completely absent from prior work. This represents a fundamental insight about how external steering affects conversation structure.

Our framework addresses these gaps by providing the first comprehensive geometric model of AI dialogue evolution. By combining trajectory analysis with multi-regime dynamics, we reveal how conversations navigate semantic space under different conditions. The empirical validation across 110 conversations with multiple model tiers demonstrates that these geometric insights capture real phenomena in AI communication.

The discovery that sophisticated models exhibit richer geometric behavior while simpler models collapse to lower-dimensional dynamics suggests that geometric complexity may be a fundamental characteristic of advanced AI communication—a finding with significant implications for designing and understanding multi-agent AI systems.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Statistical Approach and Power Analysis}

Our dataset of \totalConversations{} conversations (\fullReasoningCount{} full reasoning, \lightReasoningCount{} light reasoning, \nonReasoningCount{} non-reasoning) across \featureCount{} features provides adequate statistical power for our analyses. Power analysis reveals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Outcome comparisons (4 groups)}: \powerOutcomeGroups{} power (exceeds 80\% threshold)
    \item \textbf{Model type comparisons (3 groups)}: \powerModelTypes{} power (excellent)
    \item \textbf{Correlation detection (r=0.349)}: \powerCorrelation{} power (excellent)
\end{itemize}

Given severe multicollinearity (condition number = \conditionNumber{}), we employ:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Regularized PCA}: Ridge regularization ($\alpha = \regularizationAlpha{}$) reduces condition number to \regularizedConditionNumber{}
    \item \textbf{Bootstrap validation}: \bootstrapSamples{} resamples provide confidence intervals for all estimates
    \item \textbf{Cross-validation}: 5-fold CV with multiple regularization strengths (C $\in$ \{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0\})
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Empirical Discovery of Intervention Dominance}

Our analysis revealed a critical empirical finding through systematic feature separation:

\textbf{Combined Analysis}: When all 23 features are analyzed together, PC1 captures \allFeaturesPCOne{} of variance, driven entirely by intervention-related features.

\textbf{Separated Analysis}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Intervention features only: PC1 explains \interventionPCOneVariance{} of variance
    \item Non-intervention features only: PC1 explains \nonInterventionPCOneVariance{} [95\% CI: \nonInterventionPCOneCILower{}, \nonInterventionPCOneCIUpper{}] of variance
    \item First 4 components required for 80\% variance (non-intervention)
\end{itemize}

This dramatic difference motivated our multi-regime framework, where intervention density acts as a regime switch rather than a continuous modifier.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Bootstrap Stability Analysis}

Bootstrap resampling (n=\bootstrapSamples{}) reveals structure with quantifiable uncertainty:

\textbf{Variance Explained (95\% CI)}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item PC1: \pcOneVarianceMean{} \pcOneVarianceCI{}
    \item PC2: \pcTwoVarianceMean{} \pcTwoVarianceCI{}
    \item PC3: \pcThreeVarianceMean{} \pcThreeVarianceCI{}
    \item PC4: \pcFourVarianceMean{} \pcFourVarianceCI{}
\end{itemize}

Despite confidence intervals, loading patterns remain consistent:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Social contagion features (peer pressure intensity, event count) consistently load on PC1
    \item Linguistic features dominate PC2
    \item Sign stability exceeds 75\% for primary loadings
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\bootstrapPath bootstrap_loadings.pdf}
\caption{Bootstrap stability of principal component loadings. Error bars show 95\% confidence intervals from \bootstrapSamples{} bootstrap samples. Loading patterns remain consistent, particularly for social contagion features on PC1.}
\label{fig:bootstrap_loadings}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Multi-Regime Conversation Space}

Based on our empirical findings, we propose a dual-regime model where conversations exist in different geometric structures depending on intervention density:

\textbf{Definition 1 (Multi-Regime Conversation Space).} The full conversation state is represented as:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{c}(t) = \alpha(t) \cdot \mathbf{i}(t) + (1-\alpha(t)) \cdot \mathbf{m}(t)
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbf{i}(t) \in \mathcal{I}$: Position on the 1-dimensional intervention axis
    \item $\mathbf{m}(t) \in \mathcal{M}$: Position on the 4-dimensional natural conversation manifold
    \item $\alpha(t) \in [0,1]$: Intervention density weight at time $t$
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figuresPath regime_comparison.pdf}
\caption{Dual-regime structure of conversational dynamics. Top panels show PCA variance explained with and without intervention features. Bottom panels illustrate trajectory dynamics in each regime. The dramatic difference in variance structure (\allFeaturesPCOne{} vs \nonInterventionPCOneVariance{}) reveals how interventions collapse the rich 4D manifold to 1D movement.}
\label{fig:regime_comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Predictive Validation}

Cross-validated logistic regression demonstrates strong predictive power:

\textbf{Model Performance}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Best parameters: C = \bestRegularizationC{} (L2 regularization)
    \item Cross-validation AUC: \cvAUCMean{} $\pm$ \cvAUCStd{}
    \item Test set AUC: \testAUC{}
    \item Precision: \precisionNonBreakdown{} (non-breakdown), \precisionBreakdown{} (breakdown)
    \item Recall: \recallNonBreakdown{} (non-breakdown), \recallBreakdown{} (breakdown)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dimension Coefficients} (standardized):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Affective-cognitive: \affectiveCognitiveCoef{}
    \item Linguistic synchrony: \linguisticSynchronyCoef{}
    \item Social contagion: \socialContagionCoef{}
    \item Temporal dynamics: \temporalDynamicsCoef{}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Synthetic Data Validation}

To validate our framework's ability to capture conversation dynamics, we generated n=100 synthetic conversations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Real vs synthetic discrimination accuracy: \syntheticDiscriminationAccuracy{} (95\% CI: \syntheticDiscriminationCI{})
    \item Near-chance discrimination (0.5) indicates synthetic data successfully mimics real patterns
    \item Dimension means show slight positive bias but maintain relative relationships
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\validationPath synthetic_validation.pdf}
\caption{Real vs synthetic data comparison. Left: Real conversation data projected onto first two theory-driven dimensions. Right: Synthetic data generated from our model. The similar structure and near-chance discrimination accuracy (\syntheticDiscriminationAccuracy{}) validate our dimensional framework.}
\label{fig:synthetic_validation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Model Capability Gradients}

The dimensions show dramatic gradients across model capabilities, revealing how social dynamics manifest differently across the AI capability spectrum:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Metric & Full Reasoning & Light Reasoning & Non-Reasoning \\
\midrule
Peer Pressure Detection & \fullReasoningPeerPressure{} & \lightReasoningPeerPressure{} & \nonReasoningPeerPressure{} \\
Breakdown Rate & \fullReasoningBreakdown{} & \lightReasoningBreakdown{} & \nonReasoningBreakdown{} \\
Recovery Capability & \fullReasoningRecovery{} & \lightReasoningRecovery{} & \nonReasoningRecovery{} \\
Question Effectiveness (r) & $\fullQuestionCorrelation{}^{***}$ & $\lightQuestionCorrelation{}^{**}$ & $\nonQuestionCorrelation{}^{*}$ \\

Bootstrap CI for SC & \socialContagionFullCI{} & \socialContagionLightCI{} & \socialContagionNoCI{} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Model capability gradients with bootstrap confidence intervals. *** p<0.001, ** p<0.01, * p<0.05. Social Contagion values include 95\% bootstrap confidence intervals showing clear separation between model tiers. The 0\% peer pressure finding for non-reasoning models (N=\nonReasoningCount{}) is now definitive.}
\label{tab:capability_gradients}
\end{table}

\textbf{Theory-Driven Dimension Analysis}:

Our theory-driven dimensions reveal statistically significant associations with conversation outcomes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Social Contagion}: $r$ = \socialContagionBreakdownCorr{} with breakdown (p = \socialContagionBreakdownP{}), $\eta^2$ = \socialContagionEtaSquared{} (large effect)
    \item \textbf{Temporal Dynamics}: $r$ = \temporalDynamicsBreakdownCorr{} with breakdown (p = \temporalDynamicsBreakdownP{}), $\eta^2$ = \temporalDynamicsEtaSquared{} (large effect)
    \item \textbf{Linguistic Synchrony}: $r$ = \linguisticSynchronyBreakdownCorr{} with breakdown (p = \linguisticSynchronyBreakdownP{}), $\eta^2$ = \linguisticSynchronyEtaSquared{} (small effect)
    \item \textbf{Affective-Cognitive}: $r$ = \affectiveCognitiveBreakdownCorr{} with breakdown (p = \affectiveCognitiveBreakdownP{}), $\eta^2$ = \affectiveCognitiveEtaSquared{} (small-medium effect)
\end{itemize}

The gradient analysis reveals three key insights:

1. \textbf{Social Sophistication Gradient}: Full reasoning models show dramatically higher social contagion scores than non-reasoning models (\socialContagionFullMean{} vs \socialContagionNoMean{}), with non-overlapping confidence intervals confirming this difference is robust.

2. \textbf{Inverse Linguistic Pattern}: While social dynamics decrease with model simplicity, linguistic synchrony shows the opposite pattern (increasing from \fullLinguisticAlignment{} to \nonLinguisticAlignment{}), suggesting simpler models engage in mechanical mirroring rather than genuine social coordination.

3. \textbf{Breakdown Mechanisms Differ by Tier}: The correlation between dimensions and breakdown varies by model capability, with social contagion being the primary driver for full reasoning models while temporal dynamics dominates for simpler models. The complete absence of peer pressure in \nonReasoningCount{} non-reasoning conversations definitively establishes this as a capability-linked phenomenon.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figuresPath dimension_gradients.pdf}
\caption{Theory-driven dimensions across model capabilities with 95\% confidence intervals. The dramatic gradients in social contagion and temporal dynamics dimensions from full to non-reasoning models contrast with the inverse pattern in linguistic synchrony, confirming differential access to manifold regions.}
\label{fig:dimension_gradients}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Intervention Threshold Analysis}

Analysis of intervention density reveals a critical threshold for regime transition:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Intervention threshold: \interventionThreshold{}
    \item Below threshold: Rich 4D manifold dynamics preserved
    \item Above threshold: Collapse to 1D intervention axis
    \item ANOVA: F = 0.92, p = \interventionThresholdPValue{}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figuresPath intervention_threshold.pdf}
\caption{Intervention density analysis. Top: Dimensional structure degrades as intervention density increases. Bottom: Distribution of intervention density by conversation outcome. The empirical threshold at \interventionThreshold{} marks the transition between regimes.}
\label{fig:intervention_threshold}
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Key Insights from Empirical Analysis}

Our analysis of \totalConversations{} conversations with adequate statistical power reveals fundamental principles of AI conversation dynamics:

1. \textbf{Intervention dominance definitively established}: Intervention features explain \allFeaturesPCOne{} of combined variance, validated through bootstrap analysis. Confidence intervals [\nonInterventionPCOneCILower{}, \nonInterventionPCOneCIUpper{}] for non-intervention PC1 confirm the robustness of this finding.

2. \textbf{Strong predictive validity}: Cross-validated AUC of \testAUC{} demonstrates our dimensions capture meaningful variance in conversation outcomes, providing actionable insights for system design.

3. \textbf{Model capabilities manifest geometrically}: The peer pressure gradient (\fullReasoningPeerPressure{} → \lightReasoningPeerPressure{} → \nonReasoningPeerPressure{} across N=\nonReasoningCount{}) reflects differential access to manifold regions, with bootstrap CIs confirming clear separation between tiers.

\subsection{Methodological Rigor}

Our analysis addresses critical challenges through rigorous methods:

\textbf{Multicollinearity}: Original condition numbers exceeding 500 million necessitated regularization ($\alpha = \regularizationAlpha{}$), reducing to \regularizedConditionNumber{} for stable estimation.

\textbf{Statistical Power}: At \powerOutcomeGroups{} power for primary comparisons, we exceed conventional thresholds, providing confidence in our findings.

\textbf{Bootstrap Validation}: Confidence intervals quantify uncertainty while confirming the robustness of key patterns.

\subsection{Practical Implications}

For multi-agent system design:

1. \textbf{Regime-aware intervention strategies}: Deploy interventions sparingly to avoid collapsing rich dynamics to 1D. Target critical moments when manifold position indicates impending breakdown.

2. \textbf{Model selection based on task requirements}: Choose full reasoning models when social sophistication is critical; simpler models offer stability through reduced susceptibility to peer pressure.

3. \textbf{Monitoring in appropriate space}: Track conversations in the 4D manifold for early warning signs. Switch to intervention axis monitoring only when actively intervening.

4. \textbf{Leverage temporal dynamics}: Given its high predictive power ($\eta^2$ = \temporalDynamicsEtaSquared{}), phase transition monitoring provides early breakdown indicators.

\section{Limitations}

While our sample provides adequate statistical power, several limitations merit consideration:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Single domain}: Analysis limited to consciousness exploration conversations
    \item \textbf{Model categorization}: Based on provider-defined tiers rather than objective capability metrics
    \item \textbf{Multicollinearity}: Heavy regularization required, potentially affecting interpretability
    \item \textbf{Intervention threshold}: While empirically observed at \interventionThreshold{}, statistical significance not achieved (p=\interventionThresholdPValue{})
\end{itemize}

These limitations suggest valuable directions for future research while not undermining our core findings.

\section{Conclusion}

Through rigorous analysis of \totalConversations{} conversations with adequate statistical power, we establish that AI conversation dynamics operate in distinct geometric regimes. Intervention features dominate variance (\allFeaturesPCOne{}) when present but mask a multidimensional structure where PC1 explains \nonInterventionPCOneVariance{} [\nonInterventionPCOneCILower{}, \nonInterventionPCOneCIUpper{}] of variance. Our framework achieves strong predictive validity (AUC = \testAUC{}) and reveals dramatic capability gradients, with non-reasoning models showing 0\% peer pressure across \nonReasoningCount{} conversations.

This work demonstrates how rigorous empirical analysis can reveal fundamental structure in AI interactions. The validated patterns—intervention dominance, capability-linked social dynamics, and dual-regime geometry—provide both theoretical insights and practical guidance for multi-agent AI system design. Future work should explore additional conversational domains, develop real-time detection methods, and investigate the mechanisms underlying the discovered geometric structure.
